# Stroke Prediction System
A stroke is a medical condition in which a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked or bursts, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients in the brain cells. This can cause serious damage to the brain, leading to disability or death. Early detection and treatment of stroke can significantly improve patient outcomes, making it important to develop systems that can accurately predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring.
The goal of the stroke prediction system is to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual having a stroke in the future based on a variety of factors, including medical history, lifestyle habits, and other risk factors.
